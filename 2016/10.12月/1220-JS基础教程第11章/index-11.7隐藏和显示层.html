	<p>Love is more thicker than forget
More thinner than recall
More seldom than a wave is wet
More frequent than to fail
It is most mad and moonly
And less it shall unbe
Than all the sea which only
Is deeper than the sea
Love is less always than to win
Less never than alive
Less bigger than the least begin
Less littler than forgive
It is most sane and sunly
And more it cannot die
Than all the sky which only
Is higher than the skyLove is more thicker than forget
More thinner than recall
More seldom than a wave is wet
More frequent than to fail
It is most mad and moonly
And less it shall unbe
Than all the sea which only
Is deeper than the sea
Love is less always than to win
Less never than alive
Less bigger than the least begin
Less littler than forgive
It is most sane and sunly
And more it cannot die
Than all the sky which only
Is higher than the skyLove is more thicker than forget
More thinner than recall
More seldom than a wave is wet

<p>There was a young flower in the desert where all was dry and sad looking…… It was growing by itself…… enjoying every day…… and saying to the sun "When shall I be grown up？" And the sun would say "Be patient - Each time I touch you， you grow a little……" She was so pleased. Because she would have a chance to bring beauty to this corner of sand…… And this is all she wanted to do - bring a little bit of beauty to this world.There was a young flower in the desert where all was dry and sad looking…… It was growing by itself…… enjoying every day…… and saying to the sun "When shall I be grown up？" And the sun would say "Be patient - Each time I touch you， you grow a little……" She was so pleased.
